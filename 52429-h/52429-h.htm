</div>
<p class='c005'>The teacher should ask questions about the objects and incidents of the
reading lesson; the most difficult words of the lesson should be placed on the
board and used as an exercise in rapid pronunciation and spelling; let the
pupils pass rapidly through a paragraph, pronouncing the words of two-syllables,
three-syllables, etc.; and, as soon as the advancement of the class
will permit, the pupil should pass through a paragraph naming the parts of
speech, the phrases, the propositions, and the sentences, now and then classifying
them.</p>

<p class='c006'>Frequently, as a pupil reads, the rest of the class should be required to
close their books and turn their attention directly to what is being read; when
the reader is through, the teacher should question the listeners carefully until
every point of what was read is brought out clearly,—the reading itself to be
properly criticised. Rules of punctuation, and those concerning the use of
capitals should be deduced from the reading matter, and frequently recited.
Quotation marks, the hyphen, and the apostrophe must receive their share of
attention.</p>

<p class='c006'>Geographical terms, allusions, and figures of speech should be noted; let
the places mentioned be located and described as in geography. If prominent
men are mentioned, let brief biographical sketches be given.</p>

<p class='c006'>Before beginning the recitation, the teacher should question the class
closely in regard to what is set forth or told in the lesson. Give careful attention
to position, voice, emphasis, tone, etc. Good reading should strike our
attention as being very like good conversation.</p>

<p class='c006'>As soon as practicable, the pupils should be required to write out as a
composition the thoughts and incidents of the lesson. Occasional exercises
in parsing and analysis may be given from the reading lesson.</p>

<p class='c006'>Stories, extracts, etc., should often be read to the class, to be written out
by them in their own language. Let attention to the use of correct language
be a prominent feature of every recitation. Transformations of easy poems
into prose, and descriptions of scenes, real or imaginary, may be used in composition
work. Oral and written reproductions of reading lesson must occur
frequently. Conversations about familiar and interesting objects will give the
teacher an opportunity to correct bad language.</p>

<p class='c006'>From time to time, as opportunity offers, supplementary reading matter
may be used. Throughout the grades, two or three times a week, the pupils
should be required to commit choice quotations and to recite them clearly and
effectively.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>INSTITUTE LESSONS. Primary Arithmetic.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>1. Use each of the numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c.) one at a time, and devise many
different ways of illustrating and using each objectively.  First, the perception
of the number as a whole—then, the analysis of the number.  Part of the
work should involve subtraction.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Each number may be illustrated in many ways by large dots variously
grouped on cards.  With these cards drill the perception in quickness.  Let
each pupil arrange a certain number of “counters” in several ways
of regular form.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. On each number, ask every possible variety of question. Let the pupils
make problems. Let some be made that are to have a certain given
answer.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. As each number is used, let its script form be learned and made by the
pupils. After progressing in this way as far as 4 or 5 (some say to 9) teach the
figures.  Practice counting objects as far as 20.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. The exercises for slate work should progress very gradually. A
higher number should be introduced only after the pupils can use, with readiness,
those below it, in their many and varied combinations. Let there be
oral work consisting of easy objective problems illustrative of the slate work.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. In the black-board work the teacher should use a pointer and call for
ready and correct mental recitations, as he points to the various problems.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. The exercises for slate work may be of several different kinds: as,</p>

<div class="math">
(a) 1 and 1 are &nbsp;&nbsp;.<br />
<span class="in5">2 and 3 are &nbsp;&nbsp;.</span><br />
<span class="in9">&amp;c.</span><br />
<br />
(b) 5 less 1 are &nbsp;&nbsp;.<br />
<span class="in5">6 less 4 are &nbsp;&nbsp;.</span><br />
<span class="in9">&amp;c.</span><br />
<br />
(c) 2 and &nbsp;&nbsp;are 6.<br />
<span class="in8">and 1 are 5.</span><br />
<br />
(d) 6 less &nbsp;&nbsp;are 5.<br />
<span class="in8">less 2 are 2.</span><br />
<br />
(e) 1 1 1 2 2<br />
<span class="in5">1 1 2 2 2</span><br />
<span class="in5">1 2 3 2 3</span><br />
<span class="in5">_ _ _ _ _</span><br />
<br />
</div>

<p class='c009'>The columns of (e) may contain
from three to nine figures. The
teacher must not lengthen them at
any time beyond the ability of the
pupils.</p>

<div class="math">
(f) 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1<br />
<span class="in5">2 1 3 9 4 5 6 8 7</span><br />
<span class="in5">_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _</span><br />
<br />
</div>

<p class='c009'>The upper figure is the same in
each: the lower figures are different
and are arranged miscellaneously.
In the advancement, increase the upper
row a unit at a time, as far as 11.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. Teach the use of the signs ×, -, and =, and let the pupils have slate
work similar to the following:—</p>

<div class="math">
<span class="in1">8</span> × 5 = &nbsp;&nbsp;.<br />
<span class="in1">9</span> - 6 = &nbsp;&nbsp;.<br />
<span class="in7">&amp;c.</span><br />
<br />
12 - &nbsp;&nbsp;= 4.<br />
12 - &nbsp;&nbsp;= 8.<br />
<span class="in7">&amp;c.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="in5">+</span> 6 = 9.<br />
<span class="in5">+</span> 3 = 9.<br />
<span class="in7">&amp;c.</span><br />
<br />
</div>

<p class='c009'>9. Practice counting objects as far as 100, after which drill frequently in
writing and reading the numbers, from the black-board, as far as 100.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>10. Use exercises similar to the following:—</p>

<div class="math">
(a) 4 &nbsp;4 &nbsp;4 &nbsp;4<br />
<span class="in5">9</span> 19 29 39 &amp;c.<br />
<span class="in5">_</span> __ __ __<br />
<br />
(b) 7 &nbsp;7 &nbsp;7 &nbsp;7<br />
<span class="in5">8</span> 68 18 88 &amp;c.<br />
<span class="in5">_</span> __ __ __<br />
<br />
</div>

<p class='c009'>Let every possible combination be learned so well that the result can be
given instantly.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. For variety, along with the preceding, there may be used exercises
similar to the following:—</p>

<div class="math">
(a) 2 &nbsp;3 &nbsp;2 &nbsp;1<br />
<span class="in5">4 &nbsp;0 &nbsp;1 &nbsp;3</span><br />
<span class="in5">0 &nbsp;4 &nbsp;3 &nbsp;9</span><br />
<span class="in5">8 &nbsp;6 &nbsp;4 &nbsp;0</span><br />
<span class="in5">6 &nbsp;7 &nbsp;6 &nbsp;8</span><br />
<span class="in5">9 &nbsp;5 &nbsp;7 &nbsp;5</span><br />
<span class="in5">_ &nbsp;_ &nbsp;_ &nbsp;_</span><br />
<br />
(b) 2 + 8 + 3 + 7 + 5 = &nbsp;&nbsp;.<br />
<span class="in5">4</span> + 9 + 6 + 1 + 3 = &nbsp;&nbsp;.<br />
<br />
(c) 21 &nbsp;41 &nbsp;22<br />
<span class="in5">32</span> &nbsp;63 &nbsp;33<br />
<span class="in5">64</span> &nbsp;63 &nbsp;53<br />
<span class="in5">__</span> &nbsp;__ &nbsp;__<br />
<br />
</div>

<p class='c009'>“Carrying” may now be taught.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. Practice writing and reading numbers of three, and four, figures.
The pupils at the same time may be given exercises similar to the following:—</p>

<div class="math">
213<br />
321<br />
132<br />
413<br />
234<br />
___<br />
<br />
769<br />
758<br />
897<br />
786<br />
594<br />
___<br />
<br />
</div>

<p class='c009'>Take the last example: the pupil should be taught to
<i>think through it</i> rapidly, as follows:—4, 10, 17, 25, 34—write
the 4 and carry the 3; 3, 12, 20, 29, 34, 40,—write the
0 and carry the 4; 4, 9, 16, 24, 31, 38; write the whole result.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. Let the pupils learn to read numbers as high as millions. For a few
examples, at first, in subtraction, let the numbers in each order of the minuend
be greater than the corresponding ones in the subtrahend; as,</p>

<div class="math">
98<br />
45<br />
__<br />
<br />
1364<br />
<span class="in1">631</span><br />
____<br />
<br />
9842<br />
3512 &amp;c.<br />
____<br />
<br />
</div>

<p class='c009'>Use practical problems.</p>

<p class='c009'>14. Next, those examples necessitating “borrowing” or “carrying” may be
given; as,</p>

<div class="math">
137092<br />
<span class="in1">72348</span><br />
______<br />
<br />
6235<br />
4879<br />
____<br />
<br />
</div>

<p class='c009'>The method involving “carrying” is the better one. <i>If
equals be added to two numbers, their difference is not changed.</i>
In the last example, if 10 is added to 5, to equalize it add 1
to 7, for 10 units of one order equal one unit of the next
higher. Adding the 1 to the 7 is called “carrying.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span></div>
<div class='c001'></div>
<div class="math">
··&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 × 1 = 2<br />
::&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 × 2 = 4<br />
:: :&nbsp;&nbsp;2 × 3 = 6<br />
:: :: 2 × 4 = 8<br />
<span class="in7">&amp;c. &amp;c.</span><br />
</div>

<p class='c009'>Let the pupils recite the tables orally. Use for drill
the following problems:—</p>

<div class="math">
987654321<br />
<span class="in10">2</span><br />
_________<br />
<br />
123456789<br />
<span class="in10">2</span><br />
_________<br />
<br />
</div>

<p class='c009'>With the problem on the board let the pupil recite without the aid of the
answer. Similarly use the 3’s, 4’s, 5’s, &amp;c. Along with this part of the work,
how to multiply by a number of two or more figures may be taught. Placing
the multiplication table in the compact rectangular form found in some arithmetics
will be profitable and interesting work.</p>

<p class='c009'>16. Teach the Roman notation to C; how to tell the time of day; how to
make change with money; and how to solve easy exercises in <i>pt.</i>, <i>qt.</i>, <i>pk.</i>, and
<i>bu.</i>,—<i>gi.</i>, <i>pt.</i>, <i>qt.</i>, and <i>gal.</i>—and <i>in.</i>, <i>ft.</i>, and <i>yd.</i></p>

<p class='c009'>17. The teacher, using a pointer, should drill the pupils thoroughly on the
following table. (Try to acquire speed and correctness).</p>

<div class="math">

Method of recitation: Suppose the lesson consists of the
numbers 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.</p>

<p class='c009'>The pupils, with their knowledge of the multiplication
table, by experimental work, and from suggestions by the
teacher,—prepare their slate work as follows:</p>

<div class="math">
The divisors of 24 are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12.<br />
The divisor of 25 is 5.<br />
The divisors of 26 are 2 and 13.<br />
The divisors of 27 are 3 and 9.<br />
The divisors of 28 are 2, 4, 7, and 14.<br />
29 has no divisors.<br />
<br />
</div>

<p class='c009'>In the oral recitation, the first pupil, without referring to
his slate, recites as follows:—</p>

<p class='c009'>The divisors of 24 are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12; 2 twelves
are 24, 3 eights are 24, 4 sixes are 24, 6 fours are 24, 8
threes are 24, and twelve twos are 24.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next pupil recites as follows: The divisor of 25 is
5; 5 fives are 25.</p>

<p class='c009'>The third recites: The divisors of 26 are 2 and 13; 2
thirteens are 26, 13 twos are 26.</p>

<p class='c009'>The fourth recites: The divisors of 27 are 3 and 9; 3
nines are 27, 9 threes are 27.</p>

<p class='c009'>The fifth recites: The divisors of 28 are 2, 4, 7, and
14; 2 fourteens are 28, 4 sevens are 28, 7 fours are 28, and
14 twos are 28.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sixth recites: 29 has no divisors; it is a prime
number—a number that can be exactly divided only by
itself and unity.</p>

<p class='c008'>Most pupils are slow in learning how to study History. The plan here set
forth will lead them to understand how closely and intently the eyes of the
mind must scan each line, if nothing is to escape their vision.</p>

<p class='c009'>The teacher selects from the lesson words and expressions indicative of
the prominent ideas, and classifies them into those of <i>times</i>, <i>places</i>, <i>persons</i> and
<i>miscellaneous items</i>; the most <i>difficult words</i>, for “dictionary work”; and
<i>general topics</i>, of which the preceding divisions are analytic elements. These
elements thoroughly learned, recited, and properly combined bring into use,
language and understanding to help form a foundation for mastering and reciting
the general topics. The teacher’s analysis is placed upon the board.
From this (or a copy of their own) the pupils may prepare the lesson. First,
the pupil is to read (study) his lesson through once or twice, and then test his
work by noting how many of the <i>elements</i> of the lesson he can “recite.” To recite
an element, a pupil states how (or why) the author has used it, or in
what connection it occurs in the lesson. If it denotes a <i>person</i> to tell who he
was; if a <i>place</i> to tell where it is; &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c009'>This recitation is necessarily short, but it brings into use language and
understanding to form a foundation for mastering and reciting the general
topics.</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given

not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
